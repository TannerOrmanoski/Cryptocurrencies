# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies so a classification system can be created. The data will need to be cleaned and some columns will need to be dropped. This ETL effort gives us a clean and usable list of cryptocurrencies that are currently trading.
